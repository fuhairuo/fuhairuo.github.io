## Metal stable isotope evidence for the lunar origin and differentiation

I combined Ca and Mg stable isotope analysis for Apollo samples to probe the bulk Moon isotopic compositions and illuminate the timeline of lunar differentiation based on key samples [(Fu et al. 2023, *Communications Earth & Environment*)](https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00974-4).

## Refractory element evidence for Earth–Moon formation

I develpoed the application of refratory element compositions (Ca, Al, REEs, etc.) as a critical avenue to undertanding Moon formation mechanisms. In a recent study, We found that the bulk silicate Earth and Moon likely share nearly identical refractory element compositions, suggesting the need for a thorouly mixed proto-lunar disk [(Fu & Jacobsen 2024, *EPSL*)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2024.119008).

By intergrating pre-impact body chemical differentiation and giant-impact driven sampling for the first time, we further found that canonical giant-impact models are difficult to reproduce the observed Earth-Moon composition similarity [(Fu & Jacobsen 2025, *EPSL*)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2025.119697). This inconsistency supports a high-energy giant-impact lunar origin.

## Sulfur geochemical systematics for lunar disk evolution
I leveraged sulfur systematics—powerful tracers of high-temperature processes—to distinguish competing Moon-formation models and constrain the compositional and thermal evolution of the proto-lunar disk [(Fu & Dottin, *under review*)](https://www.researchsquare.com/article/rs-6762675/v1).

## Sulfur isotopic inisghts into early Martian magma ocean processes
I contribute to studies exploring the link between observed sulfur isotopic anomalies in Martian meteorites and magma ocean-atmpsphere exchange on early Mars (Patil, Dottin, Fu et al., *in revision*).

## Paleomagnetic constraints on true polar wander evolution

Using new paleomagnetic and geochronological results from the South China Block in the Neoproterozoic, I explored how these data reveal a newly identified fast true polar wander event. I also studied how true polar wander may have evolved over the past billion years, potentially linking to mantle thermal transitions across supercontinent cycles [(Fu et al. 2022, *Science Advances*)](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/sciadv.abo2753).

## Stable and radiogenic Ca isotopes for magma evolution and contamination

Using high-precision Ca isotopic measurements with collion-cell MC-ICP-NS (~20 ppm internal precision), I demonstrated that stable Ca isotope fractionation is a robust tracer of magma differentiation, with a case study from the Oslo Rift, Norway [(Fu et al. 2022, *EPSL*)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.epsl.2022.117743).

We are also exploring the radiogenic <sup>40</sup>Ca system (from <sup>40</sup>K decay) for dating ignesous rocks and resolving crustal contamination during magma crystallization.
